# First-Web-Page
using html scss to create a basic single page
My first attempt at creating a super basic webpage using basic html and then prettying it up with responsive css
Responsive css was implemented using media queries and flex boxes
THe webpage behaves in different ways depending on the resolution of the web page.
The page is also optimised for mobile
